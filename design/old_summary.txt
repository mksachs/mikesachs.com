I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of California, Davis where I studied computational physics and complex systems. The focus of my work was building and analyzing computer simulations of the fault system in California. This work involves many distributed computing applications, from simulation software capable of running on some of the largest computing clusters in the world, to model tuning using Hadoop, to parallelized Python scripts for statistical analysis. Throughout my academic career, I have been involved in 11 peer reviewed publications, on 6 of which I am first author, and presented my work at conferences in the United States and Asia. I am a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellow, a Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School alumnus, and a member of the Golden Key International Honors Society. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a creative director, web designer, and project manager for 10 years, most recently at Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC. I received a BFA from Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts â€“ ranked the #1 public university arts and design program in the country. My creative work received numerous accolades including a Richmond ADDY award and 10 eHealthcare Leadership awards.
