                            I am a data scientist, physicist and visual designer who is interested in the stories data 
                            can tell. I have managed teams, been part of technology start-ups, and consulted with 
                            companies both large and small. My work has been published in scientific journals, covered 
                            by the popular science press, and I have given talks at scientific conferences in Hawaii, 
                            Singapore, San Francisco, Santa Fe and New York. I studied physics at

                                implementing and maintaining a suite of online properties with a total of approximately
                                2 million unique users per month and a data collection, reporting and analytics
                                infrastructure storing information about tens of thousands of video assets across dozens
                                of distribution platforms.</li>
                            <li>&#8211; Directed the design, implementation, and deployment of a modern RESTful web
                                architecture, using Lumen, React and Node.js, which replaced an 8 year old legacy PHP
                                framework. The finished architecture more than halved the page delivery and rendering
                                time, and resulted in vastly improved stability and development time.</li>

                        <p>Data Scientist <span class="align_right">April 2014 to September 2014</span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&#8211; Developed enterprise level software designed to collect and process video usage
                                data across multiple distribution channels. This software reliably collects daily data
                                from over two gigabytes of log files and over 30,000 api calls and consolidates it into
                                a single data warehouse.</li>
                            <li>&#8211; Created a forecasting algorithm to predict the 30 day performance of new videos,
                                and processes to produce daily forecasts for all videos under 30 days old. After 15 days,
                                95&#37; of the predictions made by the algorithm were within 10&#37; of the actuals.</li>
                            <li>&#8211; Using machine learning categorization algorithms, developed a tool that uses
                                past video performance to help producers create better video titles. The tool
                                automatically selects the best algorithm and external parameters, and creates new models
                                daily. The best case model guessed the correct answer around 80&#37; of the time, while the
                                worst case was still better than chance at around 56&#37;.</li>
                            <li>&#8211; Created a process which continuously polls the YouTube and Facebook APIs to
                                collect high-frequency view data for all published videos under 30 days old. The
                                resulting data is stored in a Cassandra database and allows producers and audience
                                development to react quickly to ensure videos success.</li>
                            <li>&#8211; Developed RESTful API endpoints using Python and Flask to deliver all analytics
                                data to end users and applications.</li>

Events are displayed as the surface displacement that was generated during the event. In this animation the surface dispacements are rendered as simulated interferograms. These interferograms are typically measured from actual surface displacements using a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic_aperture_radar">interferometric synthetic aperture radar</a> or InSAR. The plot in the bottom left corner of the animation is the cumulative frequency magnitude relation. The numbers on the y-axis are the total number of events bigger than the given magnitude on the x-axis.</p>
