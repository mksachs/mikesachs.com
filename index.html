                </h3>
                <p class="description">FLYR is using AI to change how airlines price tickets. I was hired to lead the creation of end-to-end ML development tools to speed the iteration and deployment of new models. Later I was tapped to lead product development for the whole company. My team and I helped FLYR scale their product to multiple airlines, build better model evaluation techniques and introduce more robust model architectures. We also managed relationships with FLYRs airline partners including Jetblue, AirAsia and Air New Zealand.</p>
                <ul class="description">
                    <li>Created a shared vision and strong performance oriented culture for the FLYR product, program and data science teams. A total of 22 people in locations in San Francisco, Krakow Poland, and Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.
                    </li>
                    <li>Under my leadership, the team was able to transform the languishing efforts to build bespoke solutions for FLYRs two flagship customers, into FusionRM 2 &#8211; a unified airline revenue management platform that uses an LSTM neural network deployed on Google AI Platform to generate daily ticket prices for thousands of flights across multiple airlines.
                    </li>
                    <li>Led the development and deployment of FusionRM 2, re-energizing several stalled projects (some stalled for up to a year), and focusing efforts to deliver a working product, deployed in production for both of FLYRs flagship customers, in under four months.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transformed the product conversation at FLYR by developing north-star metrics for FusionRM 2. These metrics both focused the efforts of internal teams and the conversations with FLYRs customers. Before these metrics were in place, FLYRs product profile at flagship customers was shrinking, going from managing flights on &#8764;20 markets to &#8764;5. With these metrics the profile began to grow again back up to&#8764;20+ markets. Additionally, these metrics enabled FLYR to expand into pricing flights in peak times on these markets.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created the charter, defined the roadmap, and managed the work of the ML Ops team at FLYR&#8211; a hybrid team of data scientists and engineers whose purpose was to create a platform to enable FLYR to deliver data science products at scale to multiple airline customers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created clear boundaries of ownership in the production inference pipeline between the data science and engineering orgs. This enabled both data scientists and engineers to be more effective by focusing on their strengths.
                    </li>
                    <li>Designed the system architecture for FLYRs production inference pipeline. This architecture aligned the new ML Ops team which had very little experience with production scale ML pipelines so they could begin to untangle the bespoke legacy system.
                    </li>
                    <li>Armed with clear direction and ownership, the new team was able to quickly take over a system that was suffering critical production failures on a daily basis, stabilize it in a matter of weeks, and begin building performance and feature enhancements within a month.

Under my leadership, the team migrated all of DDN’s technical infrastructure to the cloud and modernized DDN’s owned-and-operated distribution channels. We also developed a data platform and deployed models to predict content performance and make recommendations for producers.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Created flexible data dashboards which delivered performance data on hundreds of distribution sources including YouTube channels, Facebook pages, owned and operated web sites, and Freewheel ad services.

                    <li>Directed the design, implementation, and deployment of a modern RESTful web architecture, using Lumen, React and Node.js, which replaced an 8 year old legacy PHP framework. The finished architecture more than halved the page delivery and rendering time, and resulted in vastly improved stability and development time.

                    </li>
                    <li>Developed a time-series forecasting algorithm based on the notion of a directed random walk, and designed to predict 12 months of video distribution network performance. The results of this algorithm were deployed corporate dashboards and used to report predicted financial performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created and deployed a forecasting algorithm to predict the 30 day performance of new videos for use in setting advertising prices. Five days after a video had been published, 95% of the algorithms predictions were within 10% of the actual 30 day view totals.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using machine learning classification algorithms, developed and deployed a tool that used past video performance to help producers create better video titles. The tool automatically selected the best algorithm and external parameters, and created new models daily. The best case model guessed the correct answer around 80% of the time, while the worst case was still better than chance at around 56%.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created a process which continuously polls the YouTube and Facebook APIs to collect high-frequency view data for all published videos under 30 days old. The resulting data is stored in a Cassandra database and allows producers and audience development to react quickly to ensure videos success.
                    </li>
