Dear Apple Hiring Team,

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I have been an Apple enthusiast for as long as I can remember. The first computer I ever bought was a Power Macintosh 7100. The opportunity to help build such amazing products as Senior Machine Learning Manager for Apple Maps is very exciting. I think my passion for Apple’s products, my proven track record of building and leading ML teams, my success applying ML at scale to drive business value, my experience at Radius Intelligence with point of interest data, and my academic experience with geo-spatial data, make me a great fit for the role.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

I spent the last four years at Netflix, where my team was responsible for analytics, experimentation, and ML for Netflix’s product and research infrastructure. My team’s goal was to build data products that supercharge the Netflix product experience in partnership with product and engineering teams, and our work ranged from building high-resolution streaming server telemetry pipelines, developing novel testing techniques to improve the speed and reliability of code deployments, to validating hypotheses about the effects of networks on the product experience using AB testing. In addition to leading my team, I also led the cross-functional effort to develop data, metrics and experimentation infrastructure for Netflix’s cloud gaming product when the company expanded into games, and the effort to develop a product-wide culture of efficiency by democratizing AWS cost and usage data. My career highlight at Netflix was building Netflix’s first ML for Systems team. I developed a charter for this domain and grew the team that became responsible for: optimizing how all Netflix AWS traffic is routed, improving global VPN detection, distributing new content intelligently across Netflix’s global content distribution network, increasing the reliability of Netflix’s big data infrastructure, and predicting traffic patterns and server utilization to manage growing audiences and to provision for live events.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Prior to Netflix, I worked at two startups, FLYR and Radius Intelligence, as well as at Discovery Digital Networks, a startup-of-sorts within Discovery Communications. At FLYR, I founded the ML Platform team and established a strong technical foundation to enable FLYR’s product to grow. At Radius, I was exposed to point of interest data by leading the research team that was responsible for the quality and comprehensiveness of Radius’s core data product – a directory of all US businesses that was updated weekly. My team researched novel methods using NLP and ML to enhance the customer experience by enriching data with more context and improving its accuracy and relevance. At Discovery Digital Networks, I was the first data hire, and built data and analytics infrastructure that collected and integrated performance data from thousands of online videos and half a dozen different distribution platforms. I also pioneered the use of ML in informing video production decisions by building systems that suggested ideas for new content based on past successes. In graduate school, my PhD research included using computer vision to analyze aerial radar interferometer images in order to predict earthquakes. Whether through my direct contributions or those of teams I have led, I have been innovating with applied ML for over 15 years.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Working at Apple would be a dream job for me. It’s hard to think of another company whose products I have had such a great relationship with for so long. I believe that my track record leading high performing ML teams, combined with my success applying ML at scale and my experience working with point of interest and geospatial data make me an excellent candidate for Senior Machine Learning Manager for Apple Maps. I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation with you.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Sincerely

\vspace{4.0\baselineskip}
