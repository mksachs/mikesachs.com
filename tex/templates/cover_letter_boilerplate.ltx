% Follow this section IMMEDIATELY with the first line of the section

Please accept my resume and coverletter as application for the role of XX at XX. I believe my unique mix of skills and experience will make me an excellent addition to your organization. I am a currently the Director of Technology and Data at Discovery Digital Networks, a role in which I am both a tech leader and a data scientist. I am also a PhD physicist and visual artist and designer. I have led creative and tech teams, been part of technology start-ups, and consulted with companies both large and small. My work has been published in scientific journals, covered by the popular science press, and I have given talks at scientific conferences in Hawaii, Singapore, San Francisco, Santa Fe and New York. I studied physics at Columbia University and the University of California, Davis, and visual design at Virginia Commonwealth University. I am a NASA Earth and Space Science fellow and a Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School alumni.

Most importantly though, I love telling stories with data -- or rather listening to the stories that data have to tell-- whether its the performance of YouTube videos or the results of earthquake simulators. The idea that there is a narrative buried in an ocean of information captivates me. It's as if these complex systems, sometimes comprised of thousands or even millions of interacting parts, are trying to tell us how they are more than just the sum of their parts, and every mountain of data is an opportunity to listen and understand.
