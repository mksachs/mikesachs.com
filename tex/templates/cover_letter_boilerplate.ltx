Dear Apple Hiring Team,
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}


I have been an Apple enthusiast for as long as I can remember. The first computer I ever bought was a Power Macintosh 7100. The opportunity to help build such amazing products as Senior Data Science Manager, AIML Data is very exciting. I think my passion for Apple’s products, experience using data to drive product improvements at scale, and success as an organizational leader make me a great fit for the role.
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}


I spent the last four years at Netflix, where my team was responsible for analytics, data science, and ML and algos for Netflix’s infrastructure. My team’s goal was to build data products designed to improve the quality, efficiency and reliability of Netflix, in partnership with product and engineering teams. Under my leadership, the team championed the use of experimentation within the streaming delivery platform and designed AB and quasi experimentation frameworks to democratize experimentation and make it part of the product culture in streaming delivery. My team also developed Netflix scale data collection, at very high resolution, to identify patterns in Netflix’s global streaming footprint, and to guide development of new streaming technologies. In addition to leading my team, I also pioneered the cross-functional effort to develop analytics, quality metrics and experimentation infrastructure for Netflix’s cloud gaming platform when the company expanded into games, and led the effort to develop a product-wide culture of efficiency by democratizing AWS cost and usage data.
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}


My career highlight at Netflix was building the ML for Systems discipline. Applying algos and ML to infrastructure problems wasn’t new for Netflix, but there was never a formal discipline around doing so. I developed a charter for this work and grew the team that became responsible for: optimization code that steers Netflix AWS traffic, ML models that do VPN detection globally, handle workload placement in AWS and optimize Spark job configuration, and algos that predict Live event traffic for service scaling.
\vspace{0.1\baselineskip}}


Prior to Netflix, I worked at two startups, FLYR and Radius, as well as at Discovery Digital Networks, a startup-of-sorts within Discovery Communications. At FLYR, I built a culture of data-driven product development by aligning the company around metrics that measured the quality of decisions that the algos at the heart of the product were making. At Radius, I built the team that pioneered using ML to evaluate the quality and accuracy of the data set at the core of Radius’s product. At Discovery Digital Networks, I was the first data hire, and eventually led a team that established the practice of data driven decision making, including using signals from models and algos to guide production decisions. Building and leading high performance teams and using data to drive decision-making and product improvements are things I have done in every role I have been in over the last 10 years.
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}


Working at Apple would be a dream job for me. It’s hard to think of another company whose products I have had such a great relationship with for so long. I also believe that my experience leading data science for infrastructure at Netflix, combined with my demonstrated success leading high-performance teams and collaborating cross-functionally to solve complex technical problems at scale, make me an excellent candidate for the Senior Data Science Manager, AIML Data at Apple. I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation with you.
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}


Sincerely

Michael Sachs
